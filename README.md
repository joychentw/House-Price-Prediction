## Objective

Our goal is to be able to forecast the future sales price and at the same time identify the factors that affect the price to predict the sales price.

## Background

According to the Wall Street Journal, the housing market has surged by 11.2% which is the fastest pace in 15 years. In fact, Google reported last week that the search “When is the housing market going to crash?” had spiked 2,450% in the past month. With the housing market evolving rapidly, it is important to understand the fluctuation in market trends. Our team would like to study which variables affect housing prices as well as how the sales number changes over the years.

**Dependent Variable:**    
SalesPrice Independent Variable: 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.    
**Number of instances:**    
1460 (Training), 1459 (Testing)    

## Methodology

We plan to achieve this through regression models and time series analysis. Directions and steps we will take includes:    
    
1. Performing regression analysis and covering different techniques like feature engineering, feature selection, sampling, regularization etc.    
2. Run machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc.     
3. Perform forecasting on the sales price using the time series model, such as ARIMA, and explore various components of it.
